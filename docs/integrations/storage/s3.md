# S3 Compatible Object Storage

<Subtitle></Subtitle>

## Introduction

The common pattern of message brokers is to delete messages after passing the defined retention policy, like time/size/number of messages.\
Memphis offers a 2nd storage tier for longer, possibly infinite retention for stored messages.\
Each message that expels from the station will automatically migrate to the 2nd storage tier.

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Configuring the integration

First, configure S3 at the integration center.\
It's a one-time configuration for an entire Memphis instance/cluster.

Please see the [storage provider configuration](#config) section below for information on how to configure the S3 integration for your provider.

### Step 2: Enable S3 per station

S3 can be used as a remote storage tier during station creation.

## Storage Provider Configuration {#config}

### Amazon

For Amazon S3 you please provide the Secret Key, Access Key, Bucket name and AWS region where your bucket is located. Leave the Endpoint URL and Path-Style checkbox empty/unchecked.

### Minio

Minio can be used as a self-hosted S3 storage (e.g. for testing). The easiest method to start Minio is using the [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/minio/minio).

In order to configure the S3 integration use the Minio password as Secret Access Key and the Minio user as Access Key ID. Minio's default credentials are: `minioadmin/minioadmin`. Alternatively an access key id and secret can be created from the Minio console.

The region can't be empty, but any user provided value will work (e.g. `my-region-1`). Next the S3 endpoint URL should be configured to point to your Minio instance. When running locally your Minio endpoint should be: `http://localhost:9000`. For Minio, Path Style should be _enabled_.

### Backblaze B2

[Backblaze B2](https://www.backblaze.com/b2/cloud-storage.html) object storage can be used by first [creating a bucket](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-create-and-manage-buckets) in B2. Next a corresponding [app key](https://www.backblaze.com/docs/cloud-storage-create-and-manage-app-keys) should be created for Memphis to be able to connect to the bucket.

When configuring the S3 integration, the app key's `keyID` should be used as Access Key ID, and the Secret Key shown when the app key was created should be used for the Secret Access Key.

The bucket name is simply the name of the B2 bucket created. The region can be found either in your B2 account settings, or in the S3 endpoint URL shown in the Bucket details. This same S3 endpoint url should be used in the S3 integration configuration (e.g. `https://s3.us-east-005.backblazeb2.com`). For Backblaze B2 the Path Style should be _enabled_.
